# Renewable Energy: Anomaly Detection in Wind Turbines

## Overview

This project builds upon the original Kaggle notebook titled [RenewWind Energy: Tuning & Pipelining ML Models](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lilyhyseni/renewind-energy-tuning-pipelining-ml-models/notebook) with a focus on developing an **Anomaly Detection System** for renewable energy infrastructures, particularly for wind turbines. The goal is to enhance the prediction of equipment failures and improve operational efficiency by detecting anomalies in sensor data.

## Project Objectives

The primary objective of the updated project is to identify potential malfunctions or performance degradations in wind turbines by analyzing patterns in sensor data. With this proactive approach, we aim to:

- Identify equipment failures ahead of time.
- Improve maintenance schedules and operational reliability.
- Reduce downtime and maintenance costs in renewable energy operations.

## Project Updates

The updated project will maintain the original codebaseâ€™s structure with enhancements targeted at:

- **Feature Engineering**: Improvements in data transformation and selection of relevant features.
- **Model Selection**: Carefully choosing models based on their effectiveness in anomaly detection.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Implementing specific metrics suitable for measuring the performance of anomaly detection models.
