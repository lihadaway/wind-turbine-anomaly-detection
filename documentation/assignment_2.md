## Task 1.1: Determine Business Objectives

**Deliverable: Project Scope Document \- Part 1**

**Background/the Problem Management Wants to Address:**  
The objective of this project is to proactively identify potential equipment failures in wind turbines through anomaly detection in sensor data. Current methods rely on general maintenance schedules, which may not be optimized and could result in unexpected downtimes. The need is to anticipate failure before they occur, thus improving maintenance efficiency and preventing costly breakdowns.

**Business Goals:**

* Primary goal: Develop an anomaly detection system that identifies potential wind turbine malfunctions based on sensor data.  
* Secondary goal: Reduce operational downtime and maintenance costs by enabling predictive maintenance.


**Business Success Criteria:**

* Success Metric: The system’s ability to detect anomalies with at least 85% accuracy. Success will also be measured by improved efficiency in maintenance operations, reducing manual inspections while increasing system automation.  
* Operational Success: Reduction in maintenance costs and downtime by 20% within the first year of deployment.


**Constraints:**

* Data Quality: The effectiveness of the anomaly detection system depends on the availability and quality of sensor data. Inadequate or noisy data can hinder model performance. Potential challenges include sensor drift, missing values, and noisy data, which could impact the model’s reliability. Data preprocessing techniques such as imputation and smoothing will be used to mitigate these issues.   
* Resource and Technology Requirements: The project demands significant computational resources to process the large volumes of sensor data effectively. Additionally, the selection of suitable tools and technologies is critical for successful implementation and scalability. The project must be completed within the semester time frame, with iterative evaluations at key checkpoints.  

**Organizational and Business Impact:**

* Financial Impact: Improvements in maintenance efficiency will reduce emergency repairs, extend the lifespan of turbines, and lower operational costs, directly improving profitability.  
* Risk Mitigation: Early detection of anomalies, promoting better risk management, protects the organization from significant losses associated with equipment failure.

## Task 1.3: Determine Data-Mining Goals

**Deliverable: Data-Mining Scope Document**

**Data Mining Goals:**

* Data Processing Goal: Clean and pre-process sensor data to ensure it is suitable for training machine learning models.  
* Modeling Goal: Develop and train a machine learning model to detect anomalies in sensor data, such as changes in temperature, pressure, and vibration patterns.  
* Report Goal: Generate a report summarizing the effectiveness of the anomaly detection system, including key metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Data-Mining Success Criteria:**

* Detection Performance: Achieve a combined target for anomaly detection accuracy and false positive rate, where the accuracy is at least 85% and the false positive rate is less than or equal to 10%, with a stretch goal of reducing it to 5% over time. This ensures that the system reliably detects true anomalies while minimizing unnecessary alerts.  
* Use F1-score as the primary performance metric to account for the trade-off between precision and recall, with a target of at least 0.80 to ensure balanced performance.  
* Model Robustness: The model should demonstrate consistent performance across diverse datasets and operational conditions, indicating its robustness and ability to generalize effectively to new, unseen data.  
* Implementation Efficiency: Ensure that the modeling process, including training, validation, and deployment, is completed within predefined time frames. The model should train within 24 hours on standard computational resources and make inferences in real-time (under 1 second per data point) for practical deployment. Specific metrics such as model training time, and inference speed should be tracked to evaluate efficiency.
